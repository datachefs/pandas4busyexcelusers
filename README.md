=====================

In Spring 2015 we're going to pilot a course, Pandas for Busy Excel Users.

This repository will contain the IPython Notebooks and the datasets used in the course.


To view it online, start with the [Welcome](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/datachefs/pandas4busyexcelusers/blob/dev/Welcome.ipynb) page.


## Why Busy Excel Users?

This course is aimed at people who are comfortable with Excel but want to move beyond its limitations.  What do we mean by "busy"? We're assuming that 
the people taking this course aren't trying to become programmers.  They've also got busy lives that may not allow them to spend lots of time
working with pandas; they may do a bunch of work in pandas to create a report or do an analysis and then not get back to writing more pandas code for months.  So, for example, there may be commands or ways of doing things in pandas that are cleaner to use but it isn't going to be obvious what 
you did when you go back to the code months from now.
